# Dice

Dice is a simple game. You have a wager and a multiplier. Higher risk, higher rewards.

### How the game works

For each bet the outcome is randomly chosen between 1x and 1,000,000x. It's up to you to guess a target that you think the outcome will exceed.

If the bet's outcome falls short of your guess, you lose your wager. But if you guessed correctly, your wager is multiplied by your guess!

Why don't you see for yourself?
