A simple game. You have a wager and a multiplier. Higher risk, higher rewards.

## How the game works

For each bet the outcome is randomly chosen between 1 and 100. It's up to you to guess a target that you think the outcome will exceed.

If the bet's outcome falls short of your guess, you lose your wager. But if you guessed correctly, your wager is multiplied by your guess!
